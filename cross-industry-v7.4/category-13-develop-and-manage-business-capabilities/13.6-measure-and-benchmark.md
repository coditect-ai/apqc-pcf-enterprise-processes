### 13.6.1 - Create and manage organizational performance strategy

**PCF ID:** 11071

**Definition:** Creating and implementing a strategy for administering organizational performance. This process element calls upon the organization to create and administer a strategy for measuring, tracking, streamlining, and improving internal performance. It encompasses creating a blueprint for the tactical measurement of internal processes and work force improvement, in alignment with Employee Metrics Developed and Managed [10526].

<summary><strong>13.6.1.1 - Create enterprise measurement systems model</strong></summary>

**Definition:** Developing a model for organization's management systems. Develop a high-level measurement system to track performance across the enterprise or in specific functions or business units. Determine which processes to measure, which measures to use, how often to measure, and measurement targets. Review strategic decisions about how to best measure an organization.


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>13.6.1.2 - Measure process efficiency</strong></summary>

**Definition:** Evaluating the efficiency of the organization's processes. Adapt evaluation to the activities and business components being measured. (Unlike process Measure staff productivity [11078], process Measures outcomes [11076] [e.g., how much of X is produced within X time period].) Measure a manufacturing process, for example, according to number of units produced per FTE or number of "high quality" units produced.


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>13.6.1.3 - Measure cost effectiveness</strong></summary>

**Definition:** Measuring the cost effectiveness of the organization's processes. Track the return on investing in marketing campaigns, new equipment, and process redefinition. Measure the cost per employee or cost per cycle for a given process, function, or business unit.


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>13.6.1.4 - Measure staff productivity</strong></summary>

**Definition:** Evaluating the productivity of employees. Measure activities performed to determine where automation could increase productivity. Identify differences between the productivity of employee groups. Evaluate the quality of work. 


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>13.6.1.5 - Measure cycle time</strong></summary>

**Definition:** Measuring how long it takes to perform certain processes or cycles of action. Select measures of customer response time, invoicing, order to cash, etc. (Actions taken based on the measurement typically exist as activities within process group Manage change [11074] or within the other function specific categories. For example, if measures indicate that the invoicing cycle is taking too long or is inconsistent, the resulting actions would take place within process Invoice the customer [10742].)
